From the book: Test-Driven Development with Python by Harry Percival.

Superlists is a project for online to-do lists.

For each new list a unique URL is created.
Existing lists can be visited and new items can be added to them.
Views and form validation are used from Django.

Currently the project is completed until chapter 11.
Chapter 12 is started.

The project is written in Python 3.3 with Django 1.7.
